This project is a development environment for a minimalist UI component library, built as a learning exercise in React. It provides an isolated space to build, view, and test individual components, inspired by the architecture of tools like Storybook.

**Disclaimer:** As a learning project, it is not as robust or feature-rich as established tools like Storybook. It is not recommended for use in production or critical projects.
